## A random Quote generator is a web App that fetches rendom quotes or piece of advice from an api and displays the data using a fetch method 
You can refer to this site through this link: https://priya591-devi.github.io/Quotes_Generator/

### This is implemented in react, so I am using a library that is AXIOS.
this lib provides many useful methods to fetch the data from the API.

example :
###     axios.get('API_LINK')
###        .then((response)=>{
###           console.log(response)
###         }
###        .catch((error) => {
###           console.log(error)
###         }
